# Thomas F. Lynn
## Welcome

I am a Postdoc at Argonne National Lab. I received my Ph.D. at Northwestern University studying Applied Mathematics.

## Research

Currently, I am investigating methods for discerning nuclei structure from &gamma;-ray spectroscopy measurements.

In my Ph.D., I studied mixing due to *cutting-and-shuffling* as it applies to systems of solid granular materials.

## Processing Sketches

I sometimes write code sketches in Processing. You can find them [here](sketches).
