## Welcome

I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University studying Appleid Mathematics. You can find my resume [here](ThomasLynn_resume_2.pdf).

## Research interests

I study mixing due to *cutting-and-shuffling* as it applies to systems of solid granular materials. Currently, I am attempting to apply mahcine learning to a simple cut-and-shuffle system (called an *ineterval exchange transform*, or *IET*), both in a *supervised learning* approach and a *reinforcement learning* approach.

## Processing Sketches

I sometimes write code sketches in Processing. You can find them [here](sketches).
