## Welcome

I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University studying Appleid Mathematics.

## Research interests

I study mixing due to cutting-and-shuffling as it applies to systems of solid granular materials.

## Processing Sketches

I sometimes write code sketches in Processing. You can find them [here](sketches).
