        This is an implementation of the bi-axial hemispherical piecewise isometry (PWI) that I study in my research. See <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.032204">my paper on this PWI</a> or <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.012204">my paper on getting meaning from the coloring</a> for more detail.
