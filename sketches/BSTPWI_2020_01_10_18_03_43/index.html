        &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; are all angles. They can take any value you want, but all possible behaviors are represented by angles between 0&deg; and 180&deg;. I think that when &alpha; = &beta;, the images are most pretty (this introduces some extra symmetry in the image).

          Letting the sketch continue to draw for a while will allow the colors to stabilize.

        This is an implementation of the bi-axial hemispherical piecewise isometry (PWI) that I studied in my PhD research. See <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.032204">my paper on this PWI</a> or <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.012204">my paper on getting meaning from the coloring</a> for more detail.

        You can find this sketch on the <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/lynntf/sketches/_Et7uxMlP">p5.js website</a> as well to play around with it.
